When I started the Flatiron School Pre-Bootcamp Prep, I knew computer programming was my passion. It was very challenging but I stuck with it for many reasons and the top two reasons are the following.
  
  2.1.) The creative aspect

	2.) The analytical aspect

It is amazing all of the creative things one can do with coding. I find it fascinating that someone can have an idea and communicate with a computer to bring that idea to fruition. But the amazing thing to me is that these ideas, that are produced from coding, have a major impact on the world. Many applications I use in my daily life and they make my life much more rewarding! I want to create something, or be part of something, that has that kind of impact on the world.  

I also enjoy the analytical aspect of coding. I like that in order for someone to be an efficient software developer, they have to plan out what they want to do and take practical steps to get there. Test Driven Development is a great example of the practicality required in coding. In TDD you need to think what you want your code to do, write a test for that and then write the code to make that test pass. After that, you write another test for how else you want your code to behave and then go back to your code and change your function, or add a new function, accordingly. And you keep doing that until you get your desired outcome.

The combination of those two aspects of computer programming are captivating. It is a very rare in a job where it's vital to use both the left and right side of the brain. It is a fun challenge to combine these two!
