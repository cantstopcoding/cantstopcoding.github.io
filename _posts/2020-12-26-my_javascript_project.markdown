I'm finally done with my Javascript project! It is a continuation of my Rails project but this time I built a single page application, using JS for the front end and fetched data from a Rails API. I plan on building the full fledged website for my friend after I graduate. A feature she wants for her website is to be able to post items she made and wants to sell, such as a dress or pants, and have people review it. I didn't assign authorization for an administrator and a guest of the site, but I plan to in the future . 

This application was by far the most challenging one yet. The project was a long, tough road but well worth it. When things are difficult, if you face it and push through, it builds character. It was hard, not only in terms of demanding myself to constantly figure things out, but also working on not beating myself up and being nice to me.

Although the app required great effort, I did have fun. I found joy in making a page function asynchronously and creating features where someone can post an item and a review to a page immediately.  I have much more of an appreciation with the complexity that goes into something that seems so simple. I'm reminded of a time I was ordering ice cream and I told the guy serving me that I didn't want vanilla because it was too simple, when the man heard me say that, he went off. He told me how vanilla was one of the toughest and most complicated ice creams to make. I thought he was crazy and still do, but after this project, I'm much more understanding of the point he was trying to make.

The biggest enigma of the app for me was posting a review on an item card. It was hard because I couldn't just make a get or post fetch call to the reviews API, retrieve it and post the reviews on the page. I had to associate the reviews with the items, which is much easier said, than done. It was even more puzzling to post a review on items I created dynamically. That probably took the longest, but I finally figured out that I needed to place an event listener on the review submit button, in the post fetch call. This difficulty made me learn so many things, including the importance of placement and scope.

The thing that helped me most in approaching and grasping Javascript and the DOM is the mantra said by the great instructor, Ayana, "When some event happens, I want to make what kind of fetch and manipulate the DOM in what kind of way?"

It was also cool using something else besides Ruby and JS and that was Bootstraps. I felt shaky with CSS and Iâ€™m glad Bootstraps makes CSS, HTML and JavaScript much easier. Bootstraps felt like a relief when I used it, I definitely will look into it more.

I'm glad I persevered through the very taxing, frustrating, and enjoyable experience of my JS project. I'm learning to enjoy the frustration of programming, it's part of the process. Understanding that makes it easier to push through and do things you thought that you couldn't do. I know in regards to coding (or anything else for that matter) with a strong will, practicality, creativity and being kind to yourself, anything can be achieved.
